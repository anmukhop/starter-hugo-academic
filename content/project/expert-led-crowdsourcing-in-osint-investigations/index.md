title: Expert-led crowdsourcing in OSINT Investigations
date: 2022-02-08T00:48:21.347Z
summary: >-
  Developed a framework for students trained in social media information
  discovery and verification skills to augment the investigative practices of
  journalists, law enforcement officers, and human rights activists. I ran five
  study sessions where students contributed to real-world investigations being
  carried out by the experts.


  I used design-based research (DBR) approach to develop the collaborative framework. Data collection was in the form of collaborative spreadsheets containing feedback from experts, semi-structured interviews with students and experts and student refelction assignments. 


  The work is in preparation for CHI 2023.
