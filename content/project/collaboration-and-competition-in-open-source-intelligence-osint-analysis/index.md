title: Collaboration and competition in Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) analysis
date: 2022-02-07T23:46:53.355Z
summary: >-
  Developed a web app for students to participate in Capture the Flag (CTF)
  events to discover, archive, verify and report possible social media
  misinformation. The Quriosinty app was used by 40 students every week during
  the Spring '21 semester.


  Here users can form teams, submit pieces of investigation through flags and judges can award points based on a rubric. I built REST API endpoints to extend the platform for integrating new OSINT tools. 


  We used a Research through Design (RtD) process to iterate on the platform and generate design recommendations for systems aimed at verification of online information. Data was collected from system logs, student reflections, and semi-structured interviews.


  The paper will be submitted to CSCW 2022.
