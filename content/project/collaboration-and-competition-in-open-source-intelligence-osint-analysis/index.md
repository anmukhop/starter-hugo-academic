Developed a web app for students to participate in Capture the Flag (CTF) events to discover, archive, verify and report possible social media misinformation. The Quriosinty app was used by 40 students every week during the Spring '21 semester.

Built REST API endpoints to extend the platform for integrating new OSINT tools. 

We used a Research through Design (RtD) process to iterate on the platform and generate design recommendations for systems aimed at verification of online information. Data was collected from system logs, student reflections, and semi-structured interviews.

The paper will be submitted to CSCW 2022.
