title: Explorable Interactive Human Reposing
date: 2021-12-09T03:53:18.992Z
summary: >-
  We design a notebook to allow the user to upload an image of a person and
  modify the pose of that person by dragging and dropping body joints.


  We use {{< staticref "https://github.com/microsoft/CoCosNet-v2" "newtab" >}} . CoCosNet-v2{{< /staticref >}}  to synthesize the image of the reposed person. We use {{< staticref "https://github.com/Hzzone/pytorch-openpose" "newtab" >}} OpenPose{{< /staticref >}} to extract the pose of the person. We use {{< staticref "https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" "newtab" >}} IPython widgets{{< /staticref >}}  to enable interaction with the extracted pose.

Design

* We first allow the user to read an image and we display the uploaded image to the user.Â 
* We then extract the pose from the body joint detection algorithm (OpenPose (https://github.com/Hzzone/pytorch-openpose)) and get two arrays (subset and candidate) representing the pose.
* We map these ambiguous arrays (subset and candidate) into a user understandable body joint skeleton and display them.
* We make the joints interactable, where users can drag and drop joints.
* We allow the user to click "replot" to get the final pose they want.
* We map the edited pose back into the ambiguous arrays (subset and candidate) to be passed into the reposing model (CoCosNet-v2 (https://github.com/microsoft/CoCosNet-v2)) to synthesize the final reposed image.
* We allow the user to use an image whose pose they like for pose extraction.
* We add "evaluate" button that will evaluate the accuracy of respecting the desired pose by utilizing the following metrics:

  * Average keypoint distance (AKD): the average distance between the pose keypoint of the output image and the input pose keypoint.
  * Missing keypoint rate (MKR): the number of pose keypoints not detected in the generated image.
