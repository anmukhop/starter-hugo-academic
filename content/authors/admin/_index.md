I am a second-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at Virginia Tech, where I am advised by {{< staticref "https://crowd.cs.vt.edu/kurt-luther" "newtab" >}} Dr. Kurt Luther{{< /staticref >}} in the {{< staticref "https://crowd.cs.vt.edu" "newtab" >}} Crowd Intelligence Lab{{< /staticref >}} . Prior to joining Grad school, I was a Software Engineer at *Microsoft* for two and a half years.  I obtained a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Computer Science and Engineering from *Jadavpur University*, India. 

In my research, I take a mixed-methods approach that combines my skills in software development and human-computer interaction. The work entails the design and evaluation of sociotechnical systems that support expert-led crowdsourcing and collaboration. Overall, I am interested in human-AI interaction projects that aim to augment the work practices of experts.
