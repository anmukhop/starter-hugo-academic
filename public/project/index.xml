      <title>Expert-led crowdsourcing in Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) Investigations</title>
      <link>https://anmukhop.github.io/project/expert-led-crowdsourcing-in-osint-investigations/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 09 Feb 2022 03:04:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://anmukhop.github.io/project/expert-led-crowdsourcing-in-osint-investigations/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Developed a framework for students trained in social media information discovery and verification skills to augment the investigative practices of journalists, law enforcement officers, and human rights activists. I ran five study sessions where students contributed to real-world investigations being carried out by the experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used design-based research (DBR) approach to develop the collaborative framework. Data collection was in the form of collaborative spreadsheets containing feedback from experts, semi-structured interviews with students and experts, and student reflection assignments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work is in preparation for CHI 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Collaboration and competition in Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) analysis</title>
      <link>https://anmukhop.github.io/project/collaboration-and-competition-in-open-source-intelligence-osint-analysis/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 07 Feb 2022 23:46:53 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://anmukhop.github.io/project/collaboration-and-competition-in-open-source-intelligence-osint-analysis/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Developed a web app for students to participate in Capture the Flag (CTF) events to discover, archive, verify and report possible social media misinformation. The Quriosinty app was used by 40 students every week during the Spring &amp;lsquo;21 semester.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here users can form teams, submit pieces of investigation through flags and judges can award points based on a rubric. I built REST API endpoints to extend the platform for integrating new OSINT tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used a Research through Design (RtD) process to iterate on the platform and generate design recommendations for systems aimed at verification of online information. Data was collected from system logs, student reflections, and semi-structured interviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper will be submitted to CSCW 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Used texture and frequency-based features along with CNN. Performed classifier combination to achieve high accuracy in the script identification task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
